# Introduction-to-Python-Assignment.ipynb
My first Github Repository.
This is an assignment to help me understand simple python codes including "for loop" and "while loop".
I was able to use plotlib, seaborn to draw Histograms, Pie chart and Line graphs.
I also made simple analyses using clean and dirty data.
